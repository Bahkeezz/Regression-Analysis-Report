# Predicting Crop Yield

## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of a regression analysis conducted to predict crop yield based on five independent variables: rainfall, soil quality index, farm size, sunlight hours, and fertilizer. The results show a very strong positive linear relationship between the predictors and crop yield, with an R-squared value of 0.999996.

## Introduction
Crop yield is a critical factor in agricultural productivity, and understanding the factors that influence it is essential for optimizing crop production. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between crop yield and five independent variables using regression analysis.

## Methodology
The study employed a multiple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between crop yield and the five independent variables. The data were collected from a reliable source, and the model was estimated using a statistical software package.

## Regression Model Overview
The regression model showed a very strong positive linear relationship between the predictors and crop yield, with a Multiple R (Correlation Coefficient) of 0.999998. The R-squared value of 0.999996 indicates that 99.9996% of the variability in crop yield is explained by the independent variables.
